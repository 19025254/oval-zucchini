Well, my venture is Army force. The purpose of the Army force is providing security to nation from enemies and wining the all wars.

It has some major risks.

1\.) Strict-rules

2\.) Unfavorable Station location

3\.) Over-confidence

4\.) Strong foreign competitors

5\.) Low online presence

**1.) Strict-rules:** Army force follows strict rules and regulation that is why people who choose to this field have to be punctual. For example, during training, it creates many terms and conditions like:

Medical test in which Person should be healthy and physically fit,

No have any scratches on his or her body like pimples or any surgery,

Must have +2 pass

Think overall fitness, not only show muscles

Should have control on emotion like fear, pain, hunger and many more

Should be able for doing high-risk under-water activities

And many more other conditions which soldiers have to done for participating in this field because if he or she is not able for doing this, they will not be selected in this field.

**2.) Unfavorable Station location**: Army force creates many tough tasks which can be dangerous for soldiers life like jumping from helicopter, explosive ordnance disposal technician used for maintaining bomb, being injured, being killed, reaching at siachen is the highest and coldest battleground in the world which is situated 19,000 feet above the sea level and temperatures around -50 degree and also one of the most dangerous place is Bharati Research center which has weather condition around -89 degree, also the submarine arm and many more.

These all tasks are dangerous because of this most of the soldiers have lost their life as they could not corporate with unfavorable weather and living condition.

3\.) Over-confidence: In this field, most of the people take some conditions easy. They think that they can do easily, don’t have need any safety and underestimated to little things which is called over-confidence and it can create problems in their life. In this field, Safety is most important concern. So, that is why one of the risks is over-confidence as this thing in any field creates dreadful effect.

**4.) Strong foreign competitors:** This field gives chance to go in many places like in foreign countries and interact with new people and also with enemies. Some countries are very powerful because they have excellent skills related to weapons and technology. That is why they can more strong than others. In this situation, soldiers can have to face many problems because they can’t perform very well and will have some fear in their hearts from strong enemies. It is not only effect to military reputation, but also the entire country.

**5.) Low online presence:** In Army force, low technology presence is difficult for soldiers. It includes many challenges like update weapons, political views, can’t connect with families. Because most of training sets into remote area or station location, here internet connection is not available. For example, in remote area, enemies can attack on soldiers; in that condition it is difficult to inform other military for helping immediately due to less internet connection. Besides this, in most of the cities, military have no enough weapons for fighting, but enemies have very efficient and faster weapons which are dangerous for whole nation because without good weapons, it is very difficult protect to whole nation. Hence, Low online presence is the biggest risk.
